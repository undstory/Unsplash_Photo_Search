# Unsplash Photo Search 

Spfu is a web application used for searching and previewing photo shared by Unsplash.com. 
The goal of this small project was pull data from Unsplash using its API by the Axios library and display it on the page using my favorite framework Vue.js. 

## Tools

* VueJS
* HTML
* SCSS 
* Bootstrap Vue 
* Axios 
* Unsplash API 

## API using 

To use the Unsplash API, you have to register as a developer (https://unsplash.com/documentation#creating-a-developer-account). Then you need to register your application to get the API key and secret. Update your API_KEY and API_SECRET in the unsplash_settings.js.

## Setup

To run this project install it locally using npm (you are required to have Node.js):

1. Install all dependency
* npm install 
2. Run
* npm run serve

## Live
